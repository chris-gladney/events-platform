# events-platform

Welcome to this events platform page; used to provide information and payment options to clients with staff and admin features.
The front-end is built with the react library while the backend is a node express server communicating with a mongodb; making this a "MERN" aplication.
The clients can view and pay for events at different locations with the option to add paid events to their google calendar.
Staff can create and view events once authenticated.
The frontend is hosted (using netlify) at "https://theatre-group-ep.netlify.app".
The backend is hosted (using render) at "https://events-platform-yhz8.onrender.com".
For more info on how to host this project locally, please clone this repository and follow the instructions in the README.md files for the ep-client and ep-server directories.
